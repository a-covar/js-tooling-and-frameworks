<h2 align="center">JS Tools and Frameworks</h2>

This app is a simple example on how to use React and Redux. The API Server has only 1 endpoint that returns an array of the names of JavaScript build tooling choices (e.g. Webpack, etc), JavaScript frameworks (e.g React, etc).

The React App allows the user to mark their opinion of each item with a positive or negative reaction (no need to persistent data). Once they have made at least 3 reactions, fetch the remainder of your items from the API and add them to the view.

#### TO EXECUTE

Run the Server
'''
cd src/server
npm install
npm test
npm start
'''

Run the UI
'''
cd src/public
npm install
npm start
'''
